# Prime Number Finder

## **Purpose**

- The purpose of this project is to make a simple app to look for Prime Numbers.

## **Capabilities**

- Finds primes indefinitely (it runs until you kill it with a keyboard interrupt [ctrl+c] on Windows while in terminal window)
- Gets rid of Semiprimes
- Gets rid of Squarefree Primes
- Stores found Primes in a text file called "prime_numbers.txt" (this file is pre-made and starts as empty as I didn't include code to create it)
- Stores the number that you were on before terminating the program in a file called "current_number.txt" (this file is pre-made and starts with just 2 as the value [to get the program off and running] as I didn't include code to create it)
  - If you'd like to start from a specific number, you can theoretically do that... Here's how you'd go about it:
    - Change the number in the current_number.txt file to whatever you want to start at
    - In the prime_numbers.txt file, you would have to add in every Prime Number up until your starting number (one number per line)

## **Notes**

- **THIS REPO IS CURRENTLY UNDERGOING A FULL OVERHAUL AND BECAUSE OF THIS IT CAN AND WILL BE BROKEN AT SOME POINTS!**
