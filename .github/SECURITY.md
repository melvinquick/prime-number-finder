# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

As this repo doesn't currently have a downloadable release, there will be no "supported versions". I will update code when I get around to breathing new life into this project.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Here's how you can [report a known vulnerability](https://github.com/melvinquick/prime-number-finder/security/advisories/new).

I will do my best to update code for this repo if vulnerablities get reported; however, this project isn't currently active, so I may not get to it right away. Once the project is active again, I will fix any issues that are present.
